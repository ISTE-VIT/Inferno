# INFERNO - Immersive Navigation for Fire Emergency Response & Neutralization Operations

INFERNO is a VR application designed to educate students and faculty about fire safety protocols by simulating panic situations with a scriptable environment featuring real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback. The application was developed using Unity and C#, with 3D models created in Blender.

## Overview

We created a 3D model of a building known as TT in VIT Vellore using an AutoCAD floor plan. The application simulates fire drills with different types of fires and evacuation paths, incorporating real-life fire extinguisher types in specific locations. Users experience the fire extinguishing process and learn the shortest paths to the nearest exits.

Our objective is to educate students and faculty about fire safety protocols by simulating panic situations with a scriptable environment featuring real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback. We implemented a grading system based on user performance, which utilizes an AI algorithm to assess different pathways, timings, and efficiency according to official protocols.

We also showcased how this project aligns with the UN's SDG goals and demonstrated the practical implementation of AR/VR in training individuals for hazardous situations.

## Features

- 3D model of the TT building
- Two fire extinguishers (foam and CO2) and a water hose
- Manual call points (alarms)
- Shortest evacuation paths
- Extinguishable fire prefabs
- Real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback
- Grading system based on user performance
- AI algorithm to assess pathways, timings, and efficiency
- Database to track anonymized user performance data
- Open-source data for researchers and training ML models
- User percentile-based score comparison

## Installation
