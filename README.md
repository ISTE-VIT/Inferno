# INFERNO - Immersive Navigation for Fire Emergency Response & Neutralization Operations

INFERNO is a VR application designed to educate students and faculty about fire safety protocols by simulating panic situations with a scriptable environment featuring real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback. The application was developed using Unity and C#, with 3D models created in Blender.

## Overview

We created a 3D model of a building known as TT in VIT Vellore using an AutoCAD floor plan. The application simulates fire drills with different types of fires and evacuation paths, incorporating real-life fire extinguisher types in specific locations. Users experience the fire extinguishing process and learn the shortest paths to the nearest exits.

Our objective is to educate students and faculty about fire safety protocols by simulating panic situations with a scriptable environment featuring real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback. We implemented a grading system based on user performance, which utilizes an AI algorithm to assess different pathways, timings, and efficiency according to official protocols.

We also showcased how this project aligns with the UN's SDG goals and demonstrated the practical implementation of AR/VR in training individuals for hazardous situations.

## Features

- 3D model of the TT building
- Two fire extinguishers (foam and CO2) and a water hose
- Manual call points (alarms)
- Shortest evacuation paths
- Extinguishable fire prefabs
- Real-time audio-visual and haptic feedback
- Grading system based on user performance
- AI algorithm to assess pathways, timings, and efficiency
- Database to track anonymized user performance data
- Open-source data for researchers and training ML models
- User percentile-based score comparison

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ISTE-VIT/Inferno.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and packages installed.

## Usage

1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Load the scene containing the TT building model.
3. Start the simulation and follow the instructions to experience the fire drill.
4. Use the fire extinguishers and follow the evacuation paths to the nearest exits.
5. Review your performance score and feedback.
